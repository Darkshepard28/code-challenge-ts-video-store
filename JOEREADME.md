## My Solution

Joe thanks for taking out the time to read all of this I'm excited for our meeting on Friday. Basically tried to make as straightforward a solution as humanly possible.
This is my first time using TypeScript and it's been a long time since using npm/nvm so it was a unique challenge. My goal was to make my solution easy to understand and 
scable based on the desire to add new movie categories and subsiquental calculation for fees for those categories. 

## Timing Breakdown 
I spent approximately 3.5 hours working on the actual solution to the problem. I spent an additional 3 hours in the beginning just trying to refresh my knowledge of npm. 

## Commands to Test
1. npm run statement 
2. npm run html-statement
